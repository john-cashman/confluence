Based on your specific needs, you can define the support period for a minimum of 2 hours to a maximum of 1 year.

By default, the end date is set to one year from the start date, and the option to auto-renew is checked. This means, by default, the support period will auto-renew each year. You can de-select auto-renew if you do not wish the support period to be renewed automatically.
