Next, the user will need to activate his/her account by following the account activation procedure sent to his/her email. Until then, the user will be marked with the status Activation pending.

Once the user has activated his/her account, the status will change to Active. Once activated, the user can log into his/her account to add a photo and manage other profile settings.
