The page Access zones allow you to manage access zones and access readers. For an access zone, you can configure access timing, create multiple readers and link readers with the zone.

To manage access control, the user should have the [user permission](UUID-80203675-f81e-998f-d13e-b61d4d3d5dc2.html) 'Manage infrastructure' (Admin app).

Once configured, an access zone can be linked with a [membership offer](https://help.vintia.com/enviso/en/134879-372514-membership-offer.html) from the Sales app (My offers > [Offer details](https://help.vintia.com/enviso/en/134879-135225-consult-offers.html) > tab Access control). As a result, at the time of access, a valid membership will additionally be validated with the configurations of the linked access zone.
