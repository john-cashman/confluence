##### Important to know


It is possible to link one Standard size ticket template with multiple tickets. However, one ticket can be linked to only one Standard size ticket template.

For tickets that are not linked with any template, the [default template](UUID-863c9d70-1b9a-dd88-b398-bed9f2daab8c.html) for Standard size tickets will be used.

It is possible to link either Ticket-type or Membership-type products to a template.

Next, you can [add translations](UUID-5320ad87-921d-ee72-df1e-273e1e1dfba5.html) for the product template.
