A user with can implement two-factor authentication in either of the two ways:

globally and make it to log in with 2FA.

and make it for the users to log in with two-factor authentication.

An individual user will be able to log in until they enable 2FA on their account. See further [2FA mandatory](UUID-91329744-a6f0-4e93-e3b7-7f913d181def.html#UUID-91329744-a6f0-4e93-e3b7-7f913d181def_section-idm457201438245443360548762264)

by the Super Admin makes it for all users to enable 2FA for their individual accounts. So when the  Super Admin disables 2FA, the users will have to manually disable 2FA for their accounts.

We recommend that the Super admins so that the users are informed about the change in the login process.

In this case, after entering the account credentials, the user will have to enter the verification code sent to the user's registered email address. For a detailed description, refer [2FA Mandatory](UUID-91329744-a6f0-4e93-e3b7-7f913d181def.html#UUID-91329744-a6f0-4e93-e3b7-7f913d181def_section-idm457201438245443360548762264)

and is for the users to log in with 2FA

In this case, when the user logs in for the first time, s/he will have the option to enable two-factor authentication and log in using account credentials and a verification code.

If the user skips enabling two-factor authentication at the time of logging in, s/he can enable it from the [profile page](UUID-a969751f-e2b4-aef0-c587-fa9dbbe27807.html) in their account.
